              <p>This is a small project I started working on, just after adding the portfolio page. As I was making the portfolio preview I realised, I needed some new projects to display. And after taking a course in back-end programming in Python I decided to test my new knowlegde, for the code language, to engrave it into me. I did NOT want to get help with making the game logic. So I didn't look at others projects or videos to help myself. I wanted to challenge myself, so I could get a better understanding of what I was working with. </p>

              <p>I had a rough idea of how I wanted to make the game logic. Beforehand have I used matrices to check for a coordinate/tile and its adjacent tiles. This knowlegde would be my foundation. I knew my biggest problem would be to see if I was able to spot four connected pieces. I thought the rest of the logic would be pretty simple, which it was. </p>

              <p>As I was making in it python and wouldn't use any libraries like pygame or other to make visuals, it would only be displayed as strings in the terminal. Though i use numpy to help me display the matrix more easely. It looks like this: </p>
